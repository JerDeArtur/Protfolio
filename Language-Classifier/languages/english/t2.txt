In 1969 a famous book entitled Perceptrons by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert showed that it was impossible for these
classes of network to learn an XOR function. It is often believed (incorrectly) that they also conjectured that a
similar result would hold for a multi-layer perceptron network. However, this is not true, as both Minsky and Papert
already knew that multi-layer perceptrons were capable of producing an XOR function. (See the page on Perceptrons (book)
for more information.) Nevertheless, the often-miscited Minsky/Papert text caused a significant decline in interest and
funding of neural network research. It took ten more years until neural network research experienced a resurgence in
the 1980s. This text was reprinted in 1987 as \"Perceptrons - Expanded Edition\" where some errors in the original
text are shown and corrected. The kernel perceptron algorithm was already introduced in 1964 by Aizerman et al.[5]
Margin bounds guarantees were given for the Perceptron algorithm in the general non-separable case first by Freund and
Schapire (1998),[1] and more recently by Mohri and Rostamizadeh (2013) who extend previous results and give new L1
bounds.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several
waves of optimism,[9][10] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[11][12] followed
 by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[10][13] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into
 subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.[14] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations,
 such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),[15] the use of particular tools ("logic" or
 artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[16][17][18] Subfields have also been based on social
 factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[14]
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning,
natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[15] General intelligence is
among the field's long-term goals.[19] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and
traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization,
artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon
computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
