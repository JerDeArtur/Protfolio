Although the perceptron initially seemed promising, it was quickly proved that perceptrons could not be trained to
recognise many classes of patterns. This caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years,
before it was recognised that a feedforward neural network with two or more layers (also called a multilayer perceptron)
had greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer (also called a single layer perceptron). Single layer
perceptrons are only capable of learning linearly separable patterns. For a classification task with some step
activation function a single node will have a single line dividing the data points forming the patterns. More nodes can
create more dividing lines, but those lines must somehow be combined to form more complex classifications. A second
layer of perceptrons, or even linear nodes, are sufficient to solve a lot of otherwise non-separable problems.
In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated
by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the
field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to
describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as
"learning" and "problem solving".[2]
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't
been done yet."[4] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be
AI[5] , having become a routine technology.[6] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include
successfully understanding human speech,[7] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess
and Go),[8] autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.
