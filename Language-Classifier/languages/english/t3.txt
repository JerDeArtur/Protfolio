Natural language processing[117] (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and understand human language. A sufficiently
powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of
knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural
language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering[118] and machine translation.[119]
 Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. "Keyword
 spotting" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for "dog" might only match documents
 with the literal word "dog" and miss a document with the word "poodle". "Lexical affinity" strategies use the
 occurrence of words such as "accident" to assess the sentiment of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can
 combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level,
 but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual
 difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be
 viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of "narrative" NLP is to embody a full
 understanding of commonsense reasoning.
